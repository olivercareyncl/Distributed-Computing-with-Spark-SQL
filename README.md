# Distributed-Computing-with-Spark-SQL
Third course in the 'Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization' offered by University of Califronia, Davis.This course is all about big data. Itâ€™s for students with SQL experience that want to take the next step on their data journey by learning distributed computing using Apache Spark.

Learning Objectives:
- Use the collaborative Databricks workspace to write scalable Spark SQL code that executes against a cluster of machines
- Create an end-to-end pipeline that reads data, transforms it, and saves the result
- Inspect the Spark UI to analyze query performance and identify bottlenecks
- Build a medallion (bronze, silver, gold) lakehouse architecture with Delta Lake to ensure the reliability, scalability, and performance of your data
